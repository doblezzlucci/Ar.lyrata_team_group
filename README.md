# Arabidopsis Lyrata comparative Analysis 

## Transposable elements analysis 

for  transposable elements the analysis  was run   for each of the 8 chromosome file  of Arabidopsis lyrata 
and also  toplevel assembly on Arabidopsis Lyrata And Arabidopsis Thaliana 

 ### TE distribution 
 
The R notebook "TE_distribution.Rmd "  runs on RepeatMasker output file ( Galaxy_statitics.txt)  would generate TE distribution plots for families 

### Kimura plot

The R notebook "Kimura_plot.Rmd "  runs on RepeatMasker output file (Galaxy_catalogue.txt)  would generate Kimura plot divergences  for most abundant families of LTR (Gypsy and Copia) 

###  LTR insertion according to chromosome positions 

The R notebook "Inerstion_deltion_LTR_counts_plot__lyrata.Rmd "  run on RepeatMasker output file (Galaxy_output_log.tabular)  would generate Inerstion and deltion of LTR_counts 
plot as well as the fraction of insertion in a chromosome position   and fraction of insertion in a chromosome position according to the kimura score plot
